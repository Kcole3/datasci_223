## Neural Networks

* Project- need code with documentation
* 10 minute presentation

* The final assignment should be around the length of 2-3 weekly projects

* Wants a group project topic by March 4th

* Weights will change in the hidden layer in order to most accurately predict the outcome

* Need to make sure that you integrate variable importance metrics into neural net

* Shallow networks are better suited for simple questions

* A dense network is a fully connected network

* Training in series vs training in parallel with tranformers

* Custom Model definition is a dense layer

* OReilly Library Access

* from which_animal document- discusses some of the components of the layers of the neural network. 

* Look at the examples with code in the lecture
