* The most challenging part of these assignments continues to be learning how to use the github interface

## Goals for the Course:
1. Learn the basics of the python language, particularly machine learning libraries and other statistical libraries that can be utilized in health research
2. Become proficient in using git/github/virtual environments for project collaboration

## Bio

I am a Canadian medical oncologist, and have a Masters of Epidemiology. I am spending a year at UCSF to complete the certificate in health data science program, where I hope to gain skills using machine learning and other AI driven analytic techniques to build clinical prediction models, and to analyze clinical trials. I am also here with my husband, who is an interventional cardiology fellow at Stanford.
