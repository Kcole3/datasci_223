I am a Canadian medical oncologist, and have a Masters of Epidemiology. I am spending a year at UCSF to complete the certificate in health data science program, where I hope to gain skills using machine learning and other AI driven analytic techniques to build clinical prediction models, and to analyze clinical trials. I am also here with my husband, who is an interventional cardiology fellow at Stanford.


## Collaborators for Assignment #2

## Instructions for Assignment #2

* Assignment done using python 3.11.7 in a jupyter notebook
* Packages required 
pandas 2.2.0
numpy 1.25.2
matplotlib 3.8.2

## Difficulties with Assignment #2
* Understanding the format of the data (particularly the image data) was the most challenging, as I needed to learn about how image data is stored, what image "hasing" was, etc.
* Slightly different syntax than R

## Goals for the Course:
1. Learn the basics of the python language, particularly machine learning libraries and other statistical libraries that can be utilized in health research
2. Become proficient in using git/github/virtual environments for project collaboration
