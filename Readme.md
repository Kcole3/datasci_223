This is a link to assignment 1: [Link](/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb)

I am a Canadian medical oncologist, and have a Masters of Epidemiology. I am spending a year at UCSF to complete the certificate in health data science program, where I hope to gain skills using machine learning and other AI driven analytic techniques to build clinical prediction models.

# Goals for the Course:
[ ] Learn the basics of the python language, particularly machine learning libraries and other statistical libraries that can be utilized in health research
[ ] Become proficient in using git/github/virtual environments for project collaboration

# Difficulties with Assignment
* Learning how to use the terminal, git, and github was new for me, so I spent quite a bit of time familiarizing myself with these tools. 
* I found downloading all the software and getting "set up" to be the most challenging part of the assignment
* The actual python programming language is new for me as well, however, was more straightforward to learn
