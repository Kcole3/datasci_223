I am a Canadian medical oncologist, and have a Masters of Epidemiology. I am spending a year at UCSF to complete the certificate in health data science program, where I hope to gain skills using machine learning and other AI driven analytic techniques to build clinical prediction models.

#Goals for the Course:
[] Learn the basics of the python language, particularly machine learning libraries and other statistical libraries that can be utilized in health research
[] Become proficient in using git/github/virtual environments for project collaboration

#Difficulties with Assignment
Learning how to use the terminal, git, github was new for me, so I spent quite a bit of time familiarizing myself with these tools, and found this the most challenging part of the assignment
THe actual python programming language is new for me as well, however, was more straightforward to learn
